# Prevention:

## 1. **Traditional Antivirus Limitations**: 
   - Traditional antivirus solutions have limitations as they may be blind to certain malware formats like zip and may fail to catch advanced threats involving social engineering tactics.

## 2. **Anti-Malware Solutions**:
   - Deploy an anti-malware solution on workstations to prevent spyware, adware, and malware as part of the OS security baseline.
   - Ensure that the anti-malware solution remains up-to-date and monitor antivirus scan results on a regular basis.
   - Create a secure system baseline image and deploy it to all servers.

## 3. **Safe Browsing Habits**:
   - Be cautious with email attachments and links from unknown sources.
   - Avoid visiting suspicious websites.
   - Keep your operating system and software updated to the latest versions.

## 4. **Safe Mode Operation**:
   - In case of a suspected malware infection, restart the computer in Safe Mode with Networking to operate with a minimal set of drivers and services, making it easier to remove malicious software.

# Remediation:

## 1. **Reporting and Detection**:
   - Report suspected malware and related vulnerabilities.
   - Employ scanning and detection mechanisms to identify malware.

## 2. **Containment and Eradication**:
   - Contain and eradicate malware to prevent further spread and damage.

## 3. **System Restoration**:
   - Correct system changes caused by malware, for instance, removing threats from an infected system.
   - The goal is to remediate threats before they cause any further damage.

## 4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular monitoring of network and system activities to spot and address anomalies that could be indicative of malware infections.

## 5. **Education and Training**:
   - Educate users and employees on recognizing phishing attempts and other malicious activities to prevent malware infections.
