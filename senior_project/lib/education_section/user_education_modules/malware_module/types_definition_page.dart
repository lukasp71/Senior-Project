### Definition of Malware
Malware, short for malicious software, is an umbrella term used to describe any type of software designed with malicious intent. This intent may include causing damage, disrupting operations, stealing sensitive data, or gaining unauthorized access to computer systems. It's important to be cognizant of the different types of malware, as each operates in unique ways and requires distinct preventative measures and remediation strategies.

### Types of Malware
1. **Adware**: Unwanted software that displays advertisements on your screen, often within a web browser, using deceptive methods to trick users into installing it on their devices.
2. **Spyware**: Secretly observes the computer user’s activities without permission and reports it to the software’s author.
3. **Virus**: Malware that attaches to another program, replicating itself by modifying other computer programs when executed by the user.
4. **Worms**: Similar to viruses but can spread across systems on their own, without any action from the user.
5. **Trojan Horse (Trojan)**: Disguises itself as a useful program to trick users into executing it, providing attackers unauthorized access to the affected computer.
6. **Ransomware**: Locks users out of their device or encrypts their files, demanding a ransom for regained access.
7. **Rootkit**: Provides the attacker with administrator privileges on the infected system, designed to stay hidden from the user and other software on the system.
8. **Keylogger**: Records all of a user’s keystrokes, typically to gather sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card details.
9. **Malicious Cryptomining (Cryptojacking)**: Uses the victim's computer resources to mine cryptocurrency without their permission.
10. **Exploits**: Takes advantage of system vulnerabilities to give the attacker access, possibly leading to data theft or further malware installation.
