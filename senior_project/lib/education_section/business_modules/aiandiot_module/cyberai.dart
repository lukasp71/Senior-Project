# AI and Machine Learning in Cybersecurity

In the modern age, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** have significantly advanced various technologies, including Cybersecurity. AI helps overcome obstacles that humans face in Cybersecurity. Here are some key ways AI and ML contribute:

## 1. Human Error in Configuration:

- **Problem:** A common issue faced by companies involves errors in system configuration. These mistakes or oversights can leave systems vulnerable to attacks and breaches.
- **AI Solution:** AI automates many tasks, providing teams with up-to-date information on emerging issues and enabling automatic resolution of these problems.

## 2. Threat Response Time:

- **Importance:** Prompt response to Cyber attacks is crucial.
- **ML Contribution:** Machine learning assists by analyzing data from attacks to quickly provide security teams with insights. It offers advice to mitigate damage and prevent future attacks.

## What Machine Learning Can Do For Us:

- **Data Classifying:** Uses predetermined rules to classify data points.
- **Data Clustering:** Identifies outliers from preset rules and groups them into collections based on similarities or anomalies.
- **Predictive Forecasting:** Analyzes existing datasets to predict potential outcomes, useful for various endpoint solutions.

## The Future of Cybersecurity

While AI and ML enhance cybersecurity practices, there are legal aspects to consider:

## 1. Data Privacy Laws

- **Challenge:** Machine Learning requires datasets, which may contain human identifiers, potentially violating privacy laws.
- **Solution:** Anonymize data points and secure the data to prevent access post-training with AI.

## 2. Lack of Knowledgeable Experts

- **Issue:** The novelty of AI and ML has resulted in a shortage of experts in the field.
- **Response:** Global demand for knowledgeable professionals is increasing. It's essential to prepare and also maintain a dedicated security team, as reliance solely on AI is not advisable.
