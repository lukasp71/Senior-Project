Cybersecurity has become a critical concern in today’s digital age as both the public and businesses become more reliant on technology. 
Given this dependency on technology, people need a place to stay up to date on recent news and educate themselves on how to properly stay protected online. 
Our senior project aims to fix this by providing an all-in-one hub to educate people and businesses on various cybersecurity concepts and provide users with the most up-to-date news related to cybersecurity and technological vulnerabilities. 
To accomplish this, we designed our website using Dart with the Flutter SDK, Firebase for the backend database and hosting of the website, NewsAPI to fetch the latest news related to cybersecurity, and NIST’s CVE API to get the most recent vulnerabilities. 
Our finished product features sections for news, recent vulnerabilities, educational content, interactive quizzes, as well as creating and managing user accounts. 
The significance of our project is in its potential to elevate the public’s knowledge of cybersecurity, in turn creating a safer digital community amongst a variety of platforms.
